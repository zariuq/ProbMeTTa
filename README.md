# ProbMeTTa

A probabilistic logic programming library for MeTTa implementing ProbLog-style distribution semantics. It compiles probabilistic programs into Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) for exact inference via weighted model counting, supporting probabilistic facts, annotated disjunctions, negation-as-failure, and evidence conditioning.

## Requirements

- [PeTTa](https://github.com/patham9/PeTTa) — a MeTTa implementation compiling to SWI-Prolog

## Quick Start

```metta
!(import! &self (library lib_import))
!(git-import! "https://github.com/Habush/ProbMeTTa.git")
!(import &self (library lib_prob))

;; Probabilistic facts
!(:: 0.7 burglary)
!(:: 0.2 earthquake)

;; Probabilistic rules
!(::=> 0.9 alarm (, burglary earthquake))
!(::=> 0.8 alarm (, burglary (naf earthquake)))
!(::=> 0.1 alarm (, (naf burglary) earthquake))

;; Query
!(?prob alarm)         ;; => 0.58
```

You can test the above and other examples [here](https://dev.rejuve.bio/probmetta/)

## Features

- **Probabilistic facts** (`::`) - `(:: 0.3 earthquake)`
- **Deterministic facts** (`fact`) and **rules** (`=>`)
- **Probabilistic rules** (`::=>`) — `(::=> 0.9 alarm (, earthquake))`
- **Annotated disjunctions** (`::`) — multi-valued random variables. `(:: (0.5 (color red)), (0.5 (color green)))`
- **Negation-as-failure** (`naf`) `(::=> 0.2 alarm (, earthquake (naf burglary)))`
- **Marginal queries** (`?prob`) — `(?prob alarm)`
- **Conditional queries** (`?prob-given`) — evidence conditioning `P(A|B) = (?prob-give A (B))`

## Examples

### Bayesian Network

```metta
!(import! &self (library lib_import))
!(git-import! "https://github.com/Habush/ProbMeTTa.git")
!(import &self (library lib_prob))

;; Deterministic facts
!(fact (person john))
!(fact (person mary))

;; Probabilistic facts
!(:: 0.7 burglary)

;; Annotated disjunction — multi-valued random variable
!(:: ((0.01 (earthquake heavy)) (0.19 (earthquake mild)) (0.8 (earthquake none))))

;; Probabilistic rules with negation-as-failure
!(::=> 0.90 alarm (, burglary (earthquake heavy)))
!(::=> 0.85 alarm (, burglary (earthquake mild)))
!(::=> 0.80 alarm (, burglary (earthquake none)))
!(::=> 0.30 alarm (, (naf burglary) (earthquake heavy)))
!(::=> 0.10 alarm (, (naf burglary) (earthquake mild)))

;; Template rule — $x grounds lazily to each person
!(::=> 0.8 (calls $x) (, alarm (person $x)))
!(::=> 0.1 (calls $x) (, (naf alarm) (person $x)))

;; Conditional query — P(burglary | calls(john) ∧ calls(mary))
!(?prob-given burglary ((calls john) (calls mary)))  ;; => 0.98074
```

### Probabilistic Graph Reachability

```metta
!(import! &self (library lib_import))
!(git-import! "https://github.com/Habush/ProbMeTTa.git")
!(import &self (library lib_prob))

!(:: 0.6 (edge 1 2))
!(:: 0.1 (edge 1 3))
!(:: 0.4 (edge 2 5))
!(:: 0.3 (edge 2 6))
!(:: 0.3 (edge 3 4))
!(:: 0.8 (edge 4 5))
!(:: 0.2 (edge 5 6))

;; Recursive path definition with inequality guard
!(=> (, (edge $x $y)) (path $x $y))
!(=> (, (edge $x $z) (neq $y $z) (path $z $y)) (path $x $y))

!(?prob (path 1 5))  ;; => 0.25824
!(?prob (path 1 6))  ;; => 0.21673
```

## Future Work

- **Tabling**: Support for recursive queries on cyclic graphs via tabled evaluation.
- **Variable reordering**: Dynamic BDD variable reordering for improved performance.
- **Continuous distributions**: Extend beyond discrete probabilistic facts to continuous distributions.
- **Approximate inference**: Sampling-based methods (MCMC, likelihood weighting) for large programs where exact BDD-based inference becomes intractable.
